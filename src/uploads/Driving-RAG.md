Abstract

Driving scenario data play an increasingly vital role in the development of intelligent vehicles and
autonomous driving. Accurate and efficient scenario data search is critical for both online vehicle
decision-making and planning, and offline scenario generation and simulations, as it allows for lever-
aging the scenario experiences to improve the overall performance. Especially with the application of
large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) systems in autonomous
driving, urgent requirements are put forward. In this paper, we introduce the Driving-RAG frame-
work to address the challenges of efficient scenario data embedding, search, and applications for RAG
systems. Our embedding model aligns fundamental scenario information and scenario distance met-
rics in the vector space. The typical scenario sampling method combined with hierarchical navigable
small world can perform efficient scenario vector search to achieve high efficiency without sacrificing
accuracy. In addition, the reorganization mechanism by graph knowledge enhances the relevance to
the prompt scenarios and augment LLM generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the pro-
posed framework on typical trajectory planning task for complex interactive scenarios such as ramps
and intersections, showcasing its advantages for RAG applications.

1 Introduction

Driving scenarios are typically defined as compre-
hensive representations of the environment and
driving behaviors within a specific temporal and
spatial range [1, 2]. They systematically describe
the states and tasks of various traffic participants,
as well as the surrounding environment, includ-
ing the road network and infrastructure. Scenario
data have played an important role in tasks related
to intelligent vehicles and robotics, such as pre-
diction [3, 4], planning [5, 6], control [7–9], and
testing [10, 11].

In the era of artificial intelligence and large
models, the developments of autonomous driving
and intelligent vehicle systems increasingly rely
on massive scenario data. On the one hand, sce-
nario data need to be well stored and labeled to
assist the efficient training and testing of models
for autonomous driving. The typical scenario plat-
forms include OpenScenario [12], MetaScenario
[1], and CommonRoad [13], etc. In particular,
previous works on scenarios enable efficient data
storage and propose graph dynamic time warp-
ing (Graph-DTW) metric for labeling complex
interactions and corner scenarios, facilitating the

collection of large amounts of valuable samples [1]
[14].
On the other hand, efficient search capabil-
ities are also essential for scenario data. Many
researches have shown that leveraging previous
experiences and knowledge enables vehicles to
make more informed decisions and perform driv-
ing tasks effectively [15–17]. A prominent appli-
cation is the integration of Large Language Mod-
els (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems [18, 19], which generate accurate
and contextually relevant responses by provid-
ing timely access to similar scenarios. The RAG
framework can support both online applications,
such as vehicle planning [20] and decision-making
[21], and offline applications, such as scenario
generation [22] and simulation [23, 24]. However,
achieving efficient retrieval of similar scenarios and
enhancing RAG applications remain challenging
and require further development.
First,
conventional
scenario
embedding
approaches encounter the problems of accuracy
or efficiency, and need to be aligned in vector
space to better distinguish scenarios for efficient
search. At present, mature pre-trained embed-
ding models mostly focus on perception data.
Unlike high-dimensional embeddings from com-
plex image/video data, scenario data require less
redundant encoding. Concise embeddings can
effectively measure scenario differences, which
reduce computational load and simplify retrieval
from database. Although researchers have pro-
posed
some
scenario
embedding
models
via
typical tasks, such as collision prediction [25],
risk assessment [26], and scenario restoration [27],
the embeddings mainly rely on the self-learning
of the neural network. Sometimes, the embedded
hidden representations are not so recognizable.
In addition, there exist some criteria that mea-
sure the distance between driving scenarios, such
as slot [28], dynamic time warping (DTW) [29],
contrastive distance [30], and Graph DTW [14]
methods. The scenarios can be compared and
then embedded into vector space according to the
distances. However, the pair-to-pair computation
style is more time consuming, and it is difficult for
new scenarios to directly obtain the embeddings.
A more accurate and efficient model that aligns
the above features should be designed.

Second, an efficient multi-level scenario sim-
ilarity search method specific to scenario distri-
bution should be established. At the first level,
various types of driving scenarios encompass het-
erogeneous vehicle behaviors and interactions [3]
[14]. Thus, instead of the unified search method,
an accurate and efficient search can be achieved
with a multi-expert indexing architecture, where
each branch serves as an expert head for a particu-
lar interaction type, allowing retrieval of scenarios
that most closely match the prompt type.
At the second level, even within the same
expert indexing cluster, scenario data remain
diverse. More important corner scenarios are
mainly concentrated at the edge of the distribu-
tion space [14, 31], which contain more valuable
information that deals with difficult and complex
cases. In contrast, the distances of most normal
scenarios are relatively close and clustered, which
causes the waste of storage and computation
resources. Taking the hierarchical navigable small
world (HNSW) method [32] as example, which
currently has almost the best performance for vec-
tor search, the dense clusters will hinder the search
process. When a prompt scenario represents a
corner case, substantial time may be spent navi-
gating out of dense clusters to locate sparse and
relevant samples, potentially leading to prema-
ture termination without achieving the retrieval
goal. Conversely, for a common scenario prompt,
precision is less critical, as a subset of represen-
tative scenarios can effectively replace the nearest
exact matches. The scenario search process should
consider these issues.
Third, to enhance the RAG applications, the
retrieval results need to be reorganized. Consider-
ing the relatively limited interpretability of vector
embeddings, scenarios beyond the nearest one in
the database may still rank among the closest
matches and could serve as valuable references.
Thus, it is beneficial to search for top-K sce-
narios closest to the prompt. Within the small
retrieval set, applying graph relations and knowl-
edge extraction [26, 33] from native scenario data
can help reorganize the search results to better
align with the prompt scenario. In addition, if the
nearest searched scenario is significantly different
from the prompt, the rare scenario will be added
to the database for future reference. Inappropriate
searched empirical cases should be discarded to

prevent LLM confusion and hallucination. More-
over, the description tokens fed into LLM should
be properly selected, not only to reduce the com-
putation cost, but also to enhance LLM contextual
understanding to capture critical information.
To solve the above issues, in this paper, we
propose Driving-RAG framework to facilitate the
scenarios embedding, indexing, and enhancing for
RAG applications. As shown in Fig. 1, we illus-
trate the challenges and corresponding solutions
in the framework.
Our contributions are mainly listed as follows:
1) To address the unrecognizable embeddings
by self-learning neural network methods, and the
time-consuming issues by detailed scenario dis-
tance metrics, we propose an aligned scenario
embedding model, where the training process
combines the advantages of both types of meth-
ods. The model based on graph convolution and
attention mechanism can effectively encode sce-
narios and achieve alignment in the feature space.
The appropriate dimension for scenario embed-
ding and the functions of each parts are also
investigated in experiments.
2) With the aligned scenario embeddings, con-
sidering the heterogeneous vehicle interactions
and behaviors, we propose a multi-level scenario
search architecture with the classified interac-
tive scenarios. In each expert interaction set, we
design a novel vector similarity search method
based on the scenario data distribution. Typi-
cal scenario data sampling combined with HNSW
(HNSW-TSD) can achieve more efficient indexing
with almost consistent accuracy. We also com-
pare the performance of other search methods, and
investigate the influences caused by the scale of
data.
3) With top-K retrieved scenarios, consider-
ing the relatively limited interpretability of vector

embeddings, we further perform reorganization by
relations extraction and level selection to obtain
the most relevant ones to avoid LLM’s confusion
and hallucination. The effectiveness of our sce-
nario data infrastructure for augmenting typical
LLM-RAG planning task is verified on different
types of scenarios in the CitySim and INTERAC-
TION datasets.
The rest of this paper is arranged as follows.
Section 2 introduces the embedding, search, and
RAG enhancing framework specific to scenario
data. Section 3 verifies the effectiveness of the
proposed framework via comparison experiments.
Finally, Section 4 concludes the paper.

2 The Driving-RAG
Framework

In this section, we introduce the Driving-RAG
framework in detail, which contains the aligned
scenario embedding model, the HNSW-TSD algo-
rithm for scenario vector similarity search, and
retrieval reorganization for augmenting LLM gen-
eration.

2.1 Aligned Scenario Embedding
Model

Based on previous works [1, 14], with scenario
data stream, scenario segments (i.e., atom scenar-
ios) are sliced and classified according to different
vehicle interaction types. Each atom scenario con-
tains independent and complete decision-making
process within a spatial and temporal range. Fur-
thermore, each scene/frame of the atom scenario is
represented and stored as a graph structure, which
has the advantages of rich semantic relations and
state descriptions of traffic participants and can
be easily converted to text tokens for LLM [17].

The following “scenarios” in this paper all refer to
the sliced scenario segments.
To obtain accurate scenario vector embeddings
in an efficient way, we train an aligned scenario
embedding model through graph restoration and
scenario distance fitting tasks.
The backbone embedding neural network is
shown in Fig. 2. Time series of graph data are
sequentially embedded by Relational Graph Con-
volutional Network (RGCN) and Transformer. In
(i + 1)th layer of RGCN, the hidden feature of
graph node i is represented as:

f l+1
i
= σ



X

cr
i = α |N r
i | ,
αV 2V /αV 2N = 1/4
(3)

where relations R is the set of relative directions
between surrounding vehicles and the ego [1], N r
i
denotes the set of neighbor indices of node i under
relation r ∈R, W l
r is learnable weight that is
shared by all edges of relation r in layer l, σ is
the sigmoid activation function, cr
i is normalized
variable considering both the type and number
of graph relations, αV 2V /αV 2N indicates that the
message passed by vehicle-to-vehicle relations is

weighted more than that passed by vehicle-to-
roadnode relations, and di,j is the node i, j’s
distance that indicates the interaction strength.
The features output by RGCN will summarize,
and then capture connections between temporal
graph contexts via multi-head attention mecha-
nism. The number of attention heads is h, the
embedding dimension is d, and the projections
of each attention head are Qi
∈
Rdq, Ki
∈
Rdi, Vi ∈Rdi. The parameters include h groups
of weight matrix pairs
 
W q

correspond-
ing to dimension (d × dq, d × dk, d × dv). Thus the
query, key and value are:

Qi = qW q
i , Ki = kW k
i , Vi = vW v
i
(4)

The attention tensor of each head is:

headi = Att (Qi, Ki, Vi) = softmax
QiKT
i
√dk


Vi

(5)
By concatenating multi-head results, the final
attention is as follows:

S = Concat (head1, . . . , headh) W 0
(6)

where the W 0 dimension is d×d, S is the potential
scenario embedding.
To train the model, first, we employ RGCN
features within an autoencoder architecture for
the graph restoration task, which predicts the
connection relationships of graphs. While the self-
learning capabilities of the network allow for the

4

extraction of basic features, they fall short of cap-
turing more recognizable and complex features
necessary for effective scenario comparison.
Second, we utilize the Graph-DTW scenario
distance metric shown in Fig. 3, which inte-
grates optimal transport and DTW to calculate
scenario distances. Previous works [14, 17] have
demonstrated that Graph-DTW effectively mea-
sures the differences between scenarios. While
it provides accurate labeling of collected scenar-
ios, the embedding task becomes time-consuming.
By leveraging the distance labels from the train-
ing scenario set, the understanding and fitting
capabilities of RGCN and Transformer models
enable us to extract richer features that account
for both semantic relationships and the spatio-
temporal evolution of scenarios, ultimately leading
to improved embeddings.
The training process is similar to contrast
learning. On the one hand, basic scenario under-
standing is maintained through graph structure
restoration and the constraints can prevent sce-
nario distances overfitting. On the other hand, the
extraction of spatio-temporal features brings the
scenario embedding distances closer to the Graph-
DTW distances where scenarios can be effectively
distinguished. From the perspective of embed-
ding performance, when the distances between the
encoded embeddings align closely with those of
the scenario metric, and when the restored graph
exhibits a high Intersection over Union (IoU),
we recognize that the model successfully extracts
useful features and achieves alignment. The loss
function of the training process is designed as:

graph of ith scenario, and d (Sx, Sy) and dl

predicted scenario distance of xth and yth sce-
nario and corresponding contrastive Graph-DTW
distance.

In Section 3.2, we will analyze the effectiveness
of each part of the model, and investigate how
many dimensions of embeddings can generally be
enough to encode and distinguish scenarios well.

2.2 HNSW-TSD Algorithm for
Efficient Scenario Search

Given the large number of scenarios, distinct inter-
action types have been classified and attributed to
several expert sets based on vehicle motion flows,
as outlined in previous works [14]. When vehi-
cles engage in specific online or simulation tasks
and seek assistance from the expert database, it
is essential that the retrieved scenarios share the
same interaction types as the prompt scenarios.
The approach ensures that the searched results
provide more relevant and accurate references.
Then, using the embedding model above, we
can obtain scenario vectors and perform efficient
search within database systems. As shown in Fig.
3, dense clusters of common scenarios cause large
space occupancy and waste of search resources. To
this end, we design a new vector search mechanism
HNSW-TSD in Algorithm 1, which combines with
HNSW and typical scenario data (TSD).
The algorithm supports flexible parameter
adjustment based on the constructed scenario
database. The density quantile, α%, should be set
higher (80%-90%), while the sampling proportion
for normal scenarios should be lower (3%-10%)
to preserve sparse scenarios and a small sub-
set of normal ones. The distance threshold D
should be set larger than the normal scenario dis-
tances to collect rare scenarios, the K should be
selected according to scenario complexity and task
requirements, and the KDE bandwidth should be
adjusted according to the data scale to ensure effi-
cient computation. The first three steps only need
to be executed once with long-cycle updates, and
the last two steps conduct efficient search with fre-
quent batch requests. This approach allows us to
search for similar scenarios in a more efficient and
accuracy-neutral way.
It is noted that there exist other vector
similarity search methods [34], such as Flat
search, Inverted Flat (IVF) [35], and Produc-
tQuantizer(PQ) [36]. Our algorithm can effec-
tively improve the search efficiency with the above
base algorithms. In Section 3.3, we will discuss

Algorithm 1 Indexing Module: HNSW-TSD
Input: S = {s1, s2, . . . , sn} : Original scenario data, density quantile α%, sampling proportion β%,
distance threshold D, Sp = {sp
1, sp
2, . . . , sp
n}: n prompt scenarios.
Output: TSD: Typical scenario data; SHNSW : Searched top-K similar scenarios from HNSW.
Steps: 1. Density Calculation:

• Each scenario si in S database is embedded as a vector vi ∈Rd, compute the density p(si) using
Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) with appropriate bandwidth W.

2. Typical Scenario Selection:

• Low-Density Scenarios: Retain all scenarios where the density p(si) is less than the α% quantile of
the density distribution: p(si) ≤Quantileα%(p(S))
• High-Density Scenarios: For scenarios where p(si)
>
Quantileα%(p(S)), sample them with
probability inversely proportional to their density: P(select(si)) =
1
p(si) with β%:

Shigh = {si ∈β% of {p(si) > Quantileα%(p(S))}}

• Construct the typical scenario data set TSD as: TSD = Slow ∪Shigh

3. HNSW Construction:

• Build the HNSW graph GHNSW from TSD. The edges are added between close vectors to form a hier-
archical structure: GHNSW = {(vi, vj) | |N(vi)|, |N(vj)| ≤M} , where M is the maximum neighbors
for adding edges.

4. Scenario Retrieval:

• Given prompt scenarios Sp, each scenario is embedded as vp
i ∈Rd. Perform nearest-neighbor search in
GHNSW to retrieve the top-K most similar scenarios: SHNSW
i
= Top-K({vj | vj ∈GHNSW}, vp
i )

5. Scenario Expansion:

• If minvj∈SHNSW
i
d(vp
i , vj) > D, it indicates the scenarios in database are inappropriate for the prompt.
The scenario data corresponding to vp
i should be added to the database for collection and future
reference.

2.3 Reorganize Scenarios for RAG
Applications

To use retrieval scenarios for enhancing LLM-
RAG systems, we take trajectory planning task

6

Algorithm 2 Enhancing Module: Retrieval Sce-
narios with Reorganization
Input: Sp = {sp
1, sp
2, . . . , sp
n}: n prompt scenarios
for each task; K: Number of top similar scenarios
for each sp
i ; M: Desired number of final retrieved
scenarios for Sp.
Output: TRAG: Scenarios for RAG applications
after retrieval and reorganization.
Steps:
1. Top-K Similar Scenarios Arrangements:

• Categorize all top-K scenarios for n prompts
into K levels as T = {T 1, T 2, . . . , T K}, where

T l = {tl
i | tl
i is in the l-th level similarity for sp
i }

2. Reorganization with Graph Relations:

• For each tl
i ∈T, extract graph relations (e.g.,
vehicle-to-vehicle relations, vehicle-to-lane rela-
tions [1, 17]) in sp
i and tl
i.
• If tl
i does not match sp
i relations, remove tl
i from
T l.

3. Sequential Level Selection:

• For l = 1, 2, . . . , K, select scenarios from each
level of T in order as needed.
• If desired M scenarios fulfill or all K levels
exhaust, break selection loop and obtain:

TRAG =

K
[

l=1
T l′where T l′ ⊂T l and |TRAG| ≤M

as example, which is a common RAG application
[16, 19]. First, n (usually 3-6) candidate trajecto-
ries are generated using 5th-degree polynomial in
different future horizons for each vehicle task to
consider multiple modals of vehicle behaviors and
multiple possibilities for the scenarios [4]. Com-
bined with the predicted states information of
surrounding interacted vehicles, several potential
scenarios are constructed and used for search-
ing multiple similar scenarios. By judging the
interaction type, we adopt corresponding embed-
ding model to obtain scenario vectors, and use
HNSW-TSD algorithm to perform top-K search
in collected scenario database.
Then, for n×K retrieval scenarios, we conduct
reorganization with graph relations extraction and

level selection, as shown in Algorithm 2. While
the scenario graph data are embedded as vectors
to serve fast retrieval, the representation may still
lack a certain degree of interpretability. Therefore,
the native knowledge of graph relations, such as
direction relations between vehicles and vehicle-
lane connections [1, 17], can be used for processing
the small part of search results. Through the
fusion of vector search and rule knowledge, it is
guaranteed that the external scenario data used
for RAG is relevant. Further by sequential level
selection, M (M << nK) scenarios are expected
to conduct in-context learning in LLM for better
performance [16, 37].

ing of CoT questions and provides the planning

3.1 Dataset and Settings

Datasets: 1) CitySim [38]: CitySim provides a
large amount of vehicle trajectory data with high-
precision aerial views by drones. One of the key
features of CitySim is the critical safety events.
In particular, the FreeWayC section provides rich
cut-in and on-ramp merging scenarios, which are
suitable for studying vehicle trajectory data in
complex traffic scenarios.
2)
INTERACTION
[39]:
INTERACTION
dataset is an international, adversarial, and coop-
erative motion dataset designed for interactive
driving scenarios with semantic maps. It provides
a rich set of data that can be used to evaluate
methods for various aspects of vehicle interac-
tions and traffic management. In particular, the
Intersection-EP section provides busy intersection
scenarios, which are suitable for studying vehicle
motion behaviors in interactive situations.
Settings: In our experiment, the scenarios
are preliminary sliced, classified, and labeled in
MetaScenario database [1, 14]. In this paper,
we mainly focus on the complex interactive sce-
nario types, i.e. conflict line in CitySim Free-
wayC and conflict line&point in INTERACTION
Intersection-EP.
With
the
scenario
database,
we conduct the vector embedding, search, and

3.2 Validation of Embedding Model
and Dimensions

The models in Section 2.1 embed prompt sce-
narios into vectors, which have been trained on
thousands of graphs and tens of thousands of
scanario distances. Here we validate the effective-
ness of the model and investigate which number
of embedding dimensions is better. As shown in
Table 1:

close to the labeled distances by Graph-DTW (the
distance is normalized in the vector space with the
farthest being 100). It indicates that the model
can measure the scenario differences, whether

for the distances between the prompts and the
database or between the other prompts. The IOU
metric of the scenario graph structures is also
high, which indicates that the model maintains
fundamental scenario understanding and achieves
features alignment.
2) When the embedding dimension is selected
as 64 or 128, the embeddings are closest to the
scenario distances. Although the IOU for graph
structure restoration is promoted as the dimension
increases, the distance bias increase. To further
balance the search efficiency and accuracy, in this
paper, we select 64 as the scenario embedding
dimension.
3) Compared to the embeddings derived from
the mathematical approach of Multi-Dimensional
Scaling (MDS) with Graph-DTW, the distances
derived by the deep neural network show a slight
deviation. However, due to the high computa-
tional demands of MDS with Graph-DTW, which
requires pairwise comparisons of scenarios and
takes over 960 ms. In contrast, the neural net-
work inference time for generating embeddings is
only 15-19 ms, making it more efficient for vehicle
tasks.
Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies for
each part of our designed model, as shown in Fig.
6. First, without the aid of RGCN’s parsing graphs
or graph restoration task, the network’s under-
standing of the scenario graphs becomes weaker,
which is reflected in a sharp decrease in IOU, and
also influences the learning of scenario distances.
Second, without the aid of distance contrastive
learning, the distance estimations will significantly
deviate, which indicates the self-learning can-
not learn so recognizable features to distinguish
the scenarios. Third, the attention mechanism

of Transformer can further promote both the
learning of the two training tasks.

3.3 Validation of HNSW-TSD
Algorithm for Similarity Search

In this part, we validate the HNSW-TSD algo-
rithm on a relatively larger data scale to better
demonstrate its effectiveness. Since the amount of
scenarios in existing datasets is not sufficient to
simulate, we expand the embeddings to 104 and
105 levels of scale in the vector space by sam-
pling and interpolating based on the density of
scenarios.
First,
in
our
simulation
environment,
we
assume that the scenario cloud database has accu-
mulated over 2 × 104 scenarios, about 100 vehi-
cles simultaneously request RAG’s aid from the
database, and each vehicle prompts n=5 scenarios
for top-4 search with final M=4 desired in-context
scenarios. The density quantile is α% = 90%,
sampling portion is β% = 5%, and D = 10 for
Algorithm 1, and the embedding dimension is 64
in this experiment. The database conducts vector
nearest-neighbor search in batch-style.
Our designed indexing mechanism are com-
pared under different base searching methods,
such as Flat, IVF, PQ. and HNSW. The brief
introductions are listed as follows:
Flat: Search the nearest neighbor directly in
vector dataset.
IVF (Inverted File Index): IVF parti-
tions the vector space into clusters and stores an
inverted index of which vectors belong to each
cluster. When searching, it first finds the closest
cluster, and then searches only the vectors within

those clusters. The IVFx represents the number of
samples clusters.
PQ (Product Quantization): PQ splits the
vector into smaller sub-vectors, quantizes each
sub-vector to a codebook of possible values. Dur-
ing search, it matches codes in the query to those
in the dataset. The PQx represents the number of
vector chunks.
HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small
World): HNSW builds a multi-level graph where
each node represents a vector, and edges con-
nect nodes that are close in the vector space.
During search, it starts at the top level and
navigates down through the graph, progressively
narrowing down the candidates. The HNSWx rep-
resents the number of node-connected neighbors
for hierarchical small worlds.

The search time statistics for different base
methods in All/Typical data are shown in Fig. 7.
We can observe that:
1) With typical scenario data, all the base
search algorithms are nearly an order of magni-
tude faster, while the search accuracy remains at
the same level without sacrificing compared to the
best Flat results.
2) Among the algorithms, the HNSW-TSD is
significantly better than IVF, PQ, Flat, etc., with
only 3ms to complete the search task in typical
scenario database. The performance is also influ-
enced by parameters required by the algorithms.
3) HNSW-TSD can overcome the problem of
involving in the dense common data. In the orig-
inal database, if the neighbourhood number of
HNSW is relatively small (e.g., 16), it may get
into the trouble of early stopping and lead to too
much deviation of search accuracy. While in typ-
ical scenario data, it will be greatly improved. In
summary, HNSW16-TSD and HNSW32-TSD are
more suitable for the searching process.
When vehicles encounter valuable corner cases,
the scenarios will also be added to expand the
database. We validate the search/add time with
the changes of embedding dimensions, as shown
in Fig. 8. It can be observed that maintaining
the embedding dimension at an appropriate value
(e.g., 64) can save both search and add time costs,
also with the accurate search results shown in
Table 1.
Next, as shown in Table 2, we conduct param-
eters sensitivity analysis, and compare the search
performance of different parameters (α, β) under
HNSW32
base method. As the α parameter
decreases from 90% to 30%, the number of
retained ”high-density scenarios” increases, result-
ing in a significant increase in search time. Due to
the relatively rare corner scenarios, the addition
of a large number of common scenarios will not
improve much search accuracy. As the β parame-
ter increases from 5% to 30%, the number of sam-
pled low-density scenarios also increases, resulting
in a significant increase in search time while little
promotion on search scenarios distance. Therefore,
(α, β) is selected as (90%, 5%) to keep the balance
between low-density and high-density scenarios,
which achieves better performance on search effi-
ciency and accuracy. For the expansion distance
parameter D, we generally select a value that is

greater than the distance between normal scenar-
ios. The D parameter can also be adjusted based
on the scenario distribution and the number of
scenarios that researchers tend to expand.
Finally, as shown in Fig. 9, the advantages
of the method become more apparent when the
size of the data increases. When the number of
accumulated scenarios reaches the scale of 105,

HNSW-TSD can still control the search time to
10ms, which is several times or even orders of
magnitude ahead of other methods. The trend
is also similar for larger amounts of data. While
stronger machine performance will alleviate the
problem, the proposed method has the ability to
improve performance for different data types, data
scales and machines. The speed of scenario search
process will enhance both the offline simulation
systems and online vehicle tasks.

3.4 The Important Role of Scenario
Search for LLM-RAG Systems

In this part, we illustrate the effectiveness for
the searched scenario data via typical LLM-RAG
trajectory planning application, which is a com-
mon way to test the performance of RAG systems
[16, 19]. Here we select GPT-4o-mini as the base
LLM, which is a lightweight and efficient model.
Hundreds of interactive scenarios are selected for
testing the task from the two datasets. As shown

in Table 3, we adopt the average displacement
error (ADE) between LLM planning trajectory
with human driving trajectory in future 3s time
horizons to calculate human-likeness, and con-
duct statistics on the rate of vehicle collisions,
out of drivable area, and vehicle goal confusion in
long-term planning. We can observe that:
1) Compared to traditional polynomial-based
planning method [40], LLM has certain reasoning
ability with well-developed scenarios descriptions
and CoTs, which significantly reduces the condi-
tions of driving out of the drivable area and goal
confusion. However, there are still relatively large
bias in LLM’s planning for agents without the
augment from retrieved human experiences.
2) After adding randomized scenarios from
the scenario database for empirical augmenta-
tion (RAG-Random), the metrics are improved.
However, random experiences can also lead to
LLM hallucination, preventing the system from
achieving optimal performance.
3) When we utilize either the all scenario data
or typical scenario data for vector HNSW similar-
ity search, the results of planning are both greatly
improved. In particular, RAG in the selected
database significantly improves the search speed
while still maintaining comparable effectiveness
with all data.
4) With Re-Organization (RO) by graph rela-
tions, the searched top-K scenarios are further
selected to ensure the consistency of relations and
intentions, which is reflected in the less deviations
and errors in planning tasks. Especially for the
goal confusion rate, vehicles are more aware of
the destinations and intentions. It suggests that
adding knowledge judgments to a few searched

data and consuming only tiny amount of time can
further improve the results.
Here we select two typical cases to demon-
strate the results, as shown in Fig. 10 11. In the
two datasets, the ego vehicle (depicted in red)
is required to navigate through intersection/ramp
while managing conflicts and potential interac-
tions with surrounding vehicles. Without the assis-
tance of RAG system, the ego vehicle struggles
with understanding the scenario and properly nav-
igating the lanes. In INTERACTION dataset,
it faces confusion when traveling in the wrong

12

direction, heading straight towards the destina-
tion against traffic. In contrast, with the help of
retrieval scenarios via RAG-TSD and RAG-TSD-
RO, the ego vehicle successfully makes the correct
decision to yield the right-of-way as it approaches
the stop line. In CitySim dataset, the ego exhibits
overly cautious behavior, driving too slowly and
conservatively. This results in difficulty for rear-
end vehicle on ramps to merge and increases the
risk of collisions. With RAG, the ego adjusts its
velocity to a more human-like level, improving
both its flow and interactions.
Despite the relatively more computational
time and memory requirements, LLM-RAG has
the ability to leverage human experience for
reasoning, which helps to minimize inexplicable
errors that may occur with traditional plan-
ning methods. The human-centric approach allows
vehicle to make more intuitive and context-aware
decisions, similar to how a human driver would
navigate complex scenarios [41]. For applications,
in offline tasks such as simulation and generation,
the framework can serve as a crucial reference
for integrating and enhancing other planners [42].
Their capacity to understand and generate con-
textually relevant solutions can provide a more
comprehensive and realistic basis for simulations.
For real-time decision-making and planning tasks,
the potential for LLM-RAG is also growing as
the computational power of in-vehicle/cloud plat-
forms gradually increases and the cost of founda-
tion models decreases.

4 Conclusion

In this paper, we present Driving-RAG, a driving
scenario data-based RAG framework optimized
for exceptional speed without compromising accu-
racy or performance. Specifically, we introduce the
scenario embedding model that achieves feature
alignment in vector space to provide suitable dis-
tinguishable embeddings for scenario data accu-
rately and efficiently. We design the HNSW-TSD
vector search algorithm, which improves the speed
by at least an order of magnitude. The embed-
ding and vector search time costs are compressed
to about 30ms at the 105 level of data scale via
128G RAM. Further by reorganization with rela-
tions extraction, the effectiveness of RAG and our
search methods are verified on typical trajectory

planning task via LLM. Compared to the gen-
eral LLM planning method, the performance is
significantly improved.
It is worth noting that although our Driving-
RAG framework is designed to address challenges
in RAG based autonomous driving, it is inherently
a generalizable solution that can be applied to a
wide range of tasks involving RAG or database
systems. In future work, we aim to further
explore the collaborative performance achieved by
integrating traditional methods with RAG-based
approaches and to discuss more applications that
can benefit from the framework.
